0	0	Activity tracks	a category that designates dimensions of group interaction-task, relational, and topic		
0	0	Anchoring	point of decision in the process of reach-testing. This cycle follows the sequence: suggestion of an idea; agreement to the idea by others; presentation of examples to clarify the idea; and affirmation or confirmation of the idea.		
0	0	Breakpoints	transition in the developmental process of a group that is represented by a change in the group activity, topic, or task		
0	0	Complex cyclic model	a path of group development that is characterized by repeated cycles of focus on problems followed by focus on solutions		
0	0	Conflict phase	a time in a group’s task effort that is characterized by free presentation of ideas and counter ideas supported by evidence and reasoning in an attempt to arrive at some decision or decisions regarding the group’s task.  Often preceded by an orientation phase and followed by an emergence phase.		
0	0	Contingency model	Both Fiedler’s and Poole’s model of group leadership that predicts leader and group effectiveness		
0	0	Delay	a breakpoint that happens when a group moves back to repeat an analysis or activity		
0	0	Disruption	a breakpoint that is represented by either a major disagreement or a conflict		
0	0	Emergence phase	period in a decision-making discussion in which dissent dissipates as a group comes to agreement on a decision		
0	0	Mediation	a conflict management technique in which disputing parties agree to negotiate with the help of an arbitrator.  Usually understood to be binding		
0	0	Multiple sequence model	a model of group development that portrays a group as moving along three activity tracks		
0	0	Normal breakpoint	a transition in the group development process where a group moves from one topic to the next or one activity to the next		
0	0	Orientation phase	the initial period in a decision-making process; characterized by the members’ establishing goals and getting to know other members		
0	0	Primary tension	an experience of tension that individual group members feel during the early stages of group evolution or at the beginning of a meeting		
0	0	Punctuated equilibrium model	a group development scheme that is characterized by sequences of stable behavior, followed by disruptive behavior, with the return of stable behavior		
0	0	Reach-test cycle	a pattern of testing an idea that involves the suggestion of the idea, agreement with the idea, presentation of examples to clarify the idea, and affirmation or rejection of the idea		
0	0	Reach-testing	introduction of a new idea based upon some anchored position in the spiral modes.  Group members accept, revise, or reject the idea through group discussion		
0	0	Reinforcement phase	the final period in decision making, in which members congratulate themselves on completing their task effectively		 
0	0	Relational activities	categories of interaction that focus on the social process		
0	0	Scapegoating	blaming others for one’s own mistake		
0	0	Secondary tension	discomfort that a group experiences, or that is experienced by individual group members, it may be beyond the tolerance threshold for tension; that is tension experienced by the group or its members that is so great that the group may no longer ignore it.  Produced from sources other than orienting activities		
0	0	Socioemotional	the dimension of a group that refers to its social and emotional make-up		
0	0	Solution oriented model	a decision-making pattern that focuses almost exclusively on finding an acceptable plan for dealing with a problem		
0	0	Task	the focus of a group’s effort that leads to the achievement of the group’s goal		
0	0	Task-process activities	categories of interaction that focus on the group’s work		
0	0	Tension releaser	a maintenance role in which the member engages in various behavior in an attempt to relax group members		
0	0	Threshold of tolerance	the level of tension experienced by an individual or group such that any tension beyond that threshold must be addressed; the maximum tension that will not debilitate an individual or a group		
0	0	Unitary sequence model	a model of group development posed by B. Aubrey Fisher that suggests a group moves through stages of orientation, conflict, emergence, and reinforcement
